# Enhancement 2: MongoDB Dashboard

This folder contains my Enhancement Two artifact for the CS-499 Computer Science Capstone. This enhancement falls under the category of Data Structures and Algorithms.

The project is an enhanced version of my MongoDB Dashboard, a Python-based web application built with Dash that visualizes and filters animal shelter data. This version features a custom Binary Search Tree (BST) for in-memory data filtering, enhanced performance through MongoDB indexing, and  improvements in input validation.
