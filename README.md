# CS499-Capstone



### 👋 About Me

Hello and welcome to my repository. My name is Matthew Guarino, and I am a Computer Science major at Southern New Hampshire University with a concentration in Information Security. My background includes hands-on experience in RF testing, cybersecurity operations, and systems auditing. All of which have shaped the practical focus of my capstone project.

Throughout my studies and career, I’ve been driven by a passion for solving real-world problems with thoughtful software solutions. This capstone is the culmination of that journey. Bringing together tools I’ve learned, challenges I’ve overcome, and systems I’ve helped secure.

Feel free to explore the project, review the enhancements, and reach out with any feedback or collaboration ideas.

### 📌 Project Overview

This repository showcases two primary artifacts, each enhanced to reflect advanced concepts in software engineering and computer science:

- 🛠 **PC Audit Tool**  
  A Python-based desktop application that scans system configurations, USB usage, and antivirus status. Enhanced for modularity, GUI responsiveness, logging, and real-time system feedback.

- 📊 **MongoDB Dashboard**  
  An interactive data dashboard built with Python, Dash, and MongoDB, used to filter and analyze animal shelter data. Enhanced using custom data structures like a Binary Search Tree (BST) and in-memory indexing for fast query performance.
